I recently cobbled together a data web app using the Streamlit open-source framework. Users can upload their own data, visualize trends and features, and finally download the newly created forecast back to their computer.

If you want to try it out yourself, you can see it in action here, assuming I have not gone over 25 hours of free app time on Heroku ðŸ˜‚

Streamlit is an awesome tool for quickly creating front ends to consume you data and analytics products. I was able to put this whole thing together in under 125 lines of code, and they pride themselves on being the quickly way to build data apps!

If youâ€™d like to see the code, you can view a snapshot here, or the whole project on Github: https://github.com/zachrenwick/streamlit_forecasting_app
